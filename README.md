# SolarLink

**SolarLink** is a PV/BIPV simulation tool for architects, fully integrated into the Autodesk Revit environment. It simplifies the entire workflow, from calculating renewable energy obligation ratios to designing and analyzing BIPV systems.

## Why SolarLink?

<img width="2048" height="1029" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f17ab60b-a34c-453c-867f-45f48e4b4548" />

For architects, designing with BIPV (Building-Integrated Photovoltaics) has been a fragmented and challenging process. Existing tools often lack integration with BIM software, don't include domestic-certified product libraries, and fail to address local regulations, breaking the continuity of the design process.

SolarLink was developed to solve these problems by:
1.  **Eliminating Tool Fragmentation**: It combines modeling, legal compliance checks, and performance simulation into a single, unified workflow inside Revit.
2.  **Providing a Rich BIPV Library**: It removes the barrier of information access by providing a ready-to-use library of KS-certified BIPV products, which can also be customized.

Our goal is to seamlessly integrate BIPV design into the architect's creative process, making sustainable design more intuitive and efficient.

## Key Features ‚ú®

* **Seamless Revit Integration**: All analysis results update automatically with design changes, enabling a continuous and uninterrupted workflow.
* **KS-Certified BIPV Library**: Comes equipped with a library of KS-certified BIPV products, which users can customize and expand to fit their needs.
* **Integrated Analysis Workflow**: Analyze mandatory renewable energy ratios, sun-hours (with Heatmap visualization), economic viability (LCC), and Zero Energy Building (ZEB) certification data all at once.
* **Ultra-Fast Simulation**: A proprietary optimization algorithm reduces EnergyPlus calculation time by 99% (e.g., from 11 minutes down to 7 seconds), providing instant feedback during the design phase.
* **Result Visualization & Export**: Intuitively check results on the dashboard and via Heatmap, and easily export them as high-resolution images and Excel files for reports and official submissions.
* **Location-Based Analysis**: Uses the Bing Map API to automatically set project location and retrieve relevant climate data.

## Quick Start üöÄ

[![SolarLink ÏÜåÍ∞ú ÏòÅÏÉÅ](https://img.youtube.com/vi/f8wLm5EgtJk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8wLm5EgtJk)

1.  After modeling in Revit, set the surfaces to be analyzed as BIPV.
2.  Run SolarLink and set your project's location to automatically perform the simulation.
3.  Review the results on the dashboard and export them as images or Excel files.
